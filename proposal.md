# Project Goal and Scope Draft
Antibiotic resistance is a growing public health threat driven by genetic mutations and horizontal gene transfer, and rapid detection of resistance determinants is critical for guiding effective treatment [1][4][5]. Whole genome sequencing now enables genotype-based identification of these determinants, but scalable and accurate prediction methods are still needed [2][6][7]. This project develops a neural network based system that predicts resistance phenotypes (susceptible vs. resistant, based on phenotypic susceptibility labels) from whole genome bacterial sequence data, training on a publicly available WGS dataset with antimicrobial susceptibility test annotations, e.g., PATRIC (primary candidate) or NDARO (backup) [3][8]; intermediate susceptibility labels will be excluded to frame the task as binary (susceptible vs. resistant) classification. Two complementary models are implemented and compared within a 2–3 month timeline: a shallow neural network baseline and a deep bidirectional RNN with attention, adapting recurrent architectures that have proven effective for whole genome sequence classification to the related but more challenging task of resistance prediction, where within-species variability makes discrimination harder than species-level identification [11][15]. The scope covers data acquisition, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score [8][9], while excluding clinical validation, wet lab confirmation, and deployment in clinical workflows.

# Proposed Neural Network Based Approach Draft
The proposed approach compares a shallow neural network baseline against a deep recurrent model, each with an input representation suited to its architecture. For the shallow model, whole genomes are encoded as k-mer frequency histograms for k = 3, 4, and 5, then concatenated into a single feature vector; this compositional representation captures local sequence statistics without manual feature engineering and has been widely validated in bacterial genome classification tasks [11][12][13]. K-mer frequency profiles may reflect shifts caused by resistance mutations, although as a composition-based summary they do not preserve positional context within the genome [3]. For the deep model, the genome is instead tokenized into an ordered sequence of k-mers (k = 5, following the reference article [11]) with learned embeddings, preserving the sequential structure that a recurrent architecture requires [11][15].

The shallow baseline is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained on the concatenated k-mer histogram vector. It provides a strong reference point and establishes whether genome composition alone is sufficient to discriminate resistant from susceptible isolates. The deep model is a bidirectional RNN (GRU or LSTM) with an attention mechanism over the hidden states, processing the ordered k-mer embedding sequence to capture positional and longer-range dependencies [11][15]. Attention may help highlight informative regions of the input sequence, potentially aiding both accuracy and model analysis [11][16]. This architecture has been validated for whole genome bacterial identification [11] and metagenomic taxonomic classification [15]; we adapt it to AMR prediction, noting that the task is more difficult because the relevant signal is subtle resistance-associated variation within a species rather than broad inter-species differences.

Both models are trained with the same stratified data splits, cross-entropy loss, and Adam optimizer to ensure a fair comparison; class weights or oversampling will be applied if label distributions are significantly imbalanced. Evaluation uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score to account for class imbalance common in AMR datasets [8][9]. Out-of-scope items include clinical validation, deployment, and extensive hyperparameter search; possible future extensions are external validation across datasets [10] and alternative deep architectures such as CNNs or transformers [12][14][17].
