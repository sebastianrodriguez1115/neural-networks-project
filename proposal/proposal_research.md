# Deep Research: How to Write a Project Proposal

This note summarizes guidance from academic sources on what makes a strong project proposal and maps it to common course sections.

## Purpose and success criteria
Most sources agree a proposal is a plan that answers three questions: what you will investigate, why it matters, and how you will do it. It must also persuade the reader that the project is relevant, grounded in prior work, methodologically sound, and feasible within time and resource limits.

Key criteria to satisfy:
- Relevance and significance: show why the problem matters and what gap you address.
- Context and grounding: show you know the state of the field and how your work fits.
- Approach and justification: explain why your method and data are appropriate.
- Feasibility: demonstrate the scope fits constraints (time, data access, compute).

## Recommended structure (general template)
Most proposals include:
- Title and short abstract or executive summary
- Introduction or background
- Literature review
- Aims and objectives
- Methods or research design
- Expected contributions and implications
- Evaluation plan
- Ethics and limitations
- References

## Section by section guidance (aligned to your course template)

### Project goal and scope
What to include:
- One to three sentences stating the problem, the goal, and the approach at a high level.
- A clear scope boundary: what is in and out.
- The expected deliverables (models, evaluation, comparison).

Quality checks:
- Can a non-specialist understand the goal?
- Does the scope match the time and resources?

Sources: University of Sheffield on purpose and feasibility; PMC on aims and objectives.

### Literature review
What to include:
- The key techniques and findings that define the current state of the field.
- Gaps or limitations that justify your project.
- A short synthesis showing how your approach builds on or differs from prior work.

Tips:
- Keep it focused on the proposal. You do not need a full literature review yet.
- Compare methods and note strengths and weaknesses.

### Case study
What to include:
- A specific prior study or system you will use as a reference point.
- Why it is relevant: similar data, similar model class, or comparable evaluation.
- How your project extends or adapts it.

Tips:
- Make the case study serve as evidence that your idea is feasible.

Source: Sheffield focus on context and approach; PMC emphasis on justification of methods.

### Training data set
What to include:
- Data source and access method.
- What labels exist and how they align to your task.
- Data volume, class balance, and any preprocessing steps.

Tips:
- Show that the data is sufficient for the model and scope.
- Note constraints or risks (class imbalance, missing labels).

Sources: Sheffield methodology guidance (data and practicalities); Scribbr research design and methods.

### Proposed neural network based approach
What to include:
- The modeling approach and why it fits the problem.
- Baseline (shallow NN) and deep model plan.
- Input representation and training details at a high level.

Tips:
- Justify architecture choices with a citation or reasoning.
- Describe evaluation in a way that lets a reader see how you will test the design.

Sources: Sheffield research design section; PMC on tying methods to objectives.

### Expected results
What to include:
- The kind of outcome you expect (e.g., improved F-score over baseline).
- The practical significance of success.

Tips:
- Do not promise exact numbers. Focus on direction and usefulness.

Sources: Sheffield on implications and contributions; Scribbr on contribution to knowledge.

### Evaluation of the solution
What to include:
- Metrics and validation strategy (accuracy, precision, recall, F-score).
- Baselines and comparisons.
- How you will check for overfitting or dataset bias.

Tips:
- Choose metrics aligned to the task and data imbalance.

Sources: Sheffield methodology and justification; PMC on rigor and analysis.

### Ethical considerations
What to include:
- Data privacy and licensing.
- Risks of misuse and how you will communicate limitations.
- Bias and fairness concerns.

Tips:
- Show awareness of harm and how you mitigate it.

Sources: PMC ethical considerations; Sheffield practicalities.

## Proposal quality checklist
- Clear problem statement and research question.
- Explicit scope and feasible timeline.
- Prior work coverage with a clear gap.
- Method choices justified by data and objective.
- Evaluation plan tied to the goal.
- Ethical risks acknowledged.
- All claims supported with citations.

Sources: Sheffield checklist; PMC guidance on credibility and feasibility.

## Common pitfalls to avoid
- Vague objectives or methods.
- No link between literature review and your method choice.
- Overly broad scope for the available time.
- Missing data access or unclear labeling.
- No plan for evaluation or failure modes.
