# Assignment
To solve the problem in the class project:
- You will need to apply two neural network-based approaches: 
    i) first, one based on shallow NNs and 
    ii) another one based on deep NNs. 

In the intermediate progress report you will need to present:
- A shallow neural network-based approach used to solve the proposed problem. 

On the other hand, in the term project final report:
- You will need to present the results of both neural network-based (NN-based) approaches:
    i)  a shallow NN-based and 
    ii) a deep-NN-based approach
used to solve your problem.

# Deliverables
## Writen Report
Use template https://micampus.unal.edu.co/mod/resource/view.php?id=1208147 , sections:

### PROJECT GOAL AND SCOPE
The goal of this project consists of a few sentences with an executive statement of the goal of the project.

### LITERATURE REVIEW
This will help you answer the question about where to start your background research. 
It will need to include some basic definitions. 
Also, should mention key technical definitions to situate the project, as well as key preliminary facts about this problem. 
All this information with additional resources is a first step necessary to help you achieve your goals successfully.

### CASE STUDY
To identify a case study; you should try to answer the question: Where can I find a partial solution/key advance on my way to the goal? 
A specific citation is required, where the case study is reported/documented. 
In addition, you need to specify the reasons why it would help your project.

### TRAINING DATA SET
In most cases, you will need to use a data set to solve your problem.
Thus, a general description of the data set to be used to train the neural network(s) must be provided.
Otherwise, you will need to provide a general description of the approach used to solve the problem.

### PROPOSED NEURAL NETWORK BASED APPROACH
Describe the proposed neural network-based approach to solve the problem.
The types of neural networks and particular architectures that you intend to use need to be mentioned, explaining the reasons for your choice.

### EXPECTED RESULTS
In this section you will need to state what you expect to find in your class project. 
The purpose of this section is to provide a summary of the project's goals, as well as give an overview of what you expect to be found out.
Writing about the expected results of your project in your proposal helps you establish the significance of your study.
Since it is not possible to predict the exact outcome of your project, in this stage, your expected results need not be accurate. 
However, you can describe the overall outcome that can be expected from your project.

### EVALUATION OF THE SOLUTION
In this section you will need to describe how you are going to evaluate the solution that you will implement.

### ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS/QUESTIONS
You will need to ask yourself questions regarding the process of developing your project and the impact of your solutions.
In general, ethical considerations in research are a set of principles that guide your research designs and practices.
These principles include voluntary participation, informed consent, anonymity, confidentiality, potential for harm, and communication of the results.

## SOURCE CODE IMPLEMENTATION ACCESS
GitHub

## EXPLANATORY VIDEO OF YOUR REPORT
You will need to present the term project proposal in a video that does not exceed 2 minutes.
