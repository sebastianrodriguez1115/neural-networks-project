# Progress Log

## General Goal
- Develop a project proposal for detecting bacterial antibiotic resistance mutations using neural network approaches inspired by the reference article, documenting decisions and steps in this log.

## Source Policy
- This is an academic work; every factual claim must be backed by reputable sources.
- Reputable sources: peer-reviewed journal articles, official government or public health agencies, university or research institute publications, and established scientific publishers. Avoid blogs, unreviewed opinion pieces, or unsourced claims.

## Completed
- Read the reference article (RNN for whole genome bacteria identification).
- Reverted `proposal_description.md` to keep it unchanged.
- Created `proposal_draft.md` as the draft workspace (currently empty).
- Created `proposal_research.md` with proposal-writing guidance and sources.
- Drafted the Project Goal and Scope section in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Expanded Project Goal and Scope with problem, goal, approach, and executive summary in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Collected reputable sources for the problem definition in `problem_definition_sources.md`.
- Added numbered citations to the problem definition in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Replaced problem definition sources with PMC/Nature Reviews Genetics citations due to Frontiers reputation concerns.
- Expanded problem definition sources to 10 items across multiple publishers (ASM, Nature, Cell Press, Oxford, Springer Nature).
- Added brief summaries to each source in `problem_definition_sources.md`.
- Expanded source summaries in `problem_definition_sources.md` for more detail.
- Expanded the Problem Definition in `proposal_draft.md` using the new sources.
- Updated project goal wording to refer to multiple reference articles.
- Searched for related articles to the reference PDF.
- Consolidated sources into `sources.md` with sections and removed `problem_definition_sources.md`.
- Added recent related articles to `sources.md` with explicit relation notes.
- Added relation notes for sources [11]-[16] in `sources.md`.
- Added a detailed Proposed Neural Network Based Approach section in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Moved detailed guidance into the existing `### Proposed Approach` section in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Renamed and expanded the Project Goal and Scope summary in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Revised the writing style of the Project Goal and Scope text in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Adjusted evaluation scope for a 2–3 month timeline and added next steps in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Updated Project Goal and Scope to reflect the 2–3 month timeline in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Drafted the PROPOSED NEURAL NETWORK BASED APPROACH section in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Restored the original `### Proposed Approach` section and kept the new draft section in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Restored `### Project Goal and Scope Draft` heading in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Moved the Proposed Approach draft content into `# PROPOSED NEURAL NETWORK BASED APPROACH` and left a pointer in `## Proposed Approach`.
- Added two-paragraph draft under `## Proposed Neural Network Based Approach Draft` in `proposal_draft.md`.
- Created `proposal.md` with the two draft sections for submission.
- Added a cited-sources section in `sources.md` and renumbered citations in `proposal.md`.
- Added an IEEE-style reference list to `sources.md`.

## In Progress
- Planning the proposal content for the new project topic (antibiotic resistance mutation detection).
